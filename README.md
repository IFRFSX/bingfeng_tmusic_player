# tmusic_player
Music player for Minetest.

This mod allows you to play music in Minetest with an easy to use interface.  It allows for playing, stopping, and looping music.  There is a built in help feature as well.

Adding Music:
- To add music, you must make sure that your sound file is an OGG Vorbis.  You must name the file "tmusic_player_soundname", where soundname would be the name of the song.  Place this file into the sounds folder and delete the space filler text document.  Do not leave the text document in there because it will serve no purpose and play nothing.

Using the Interface:
- To open the interface, type "/music" in chat.  It will open the Interface.
    - Help:
     - If you need a refresher in-game, you can press "Help" for instructions.
    - Play:
      - To play a song, enter the song name, exactly as shown in the list, into the text box at the bottom of the form.  Then press "Play", if your song did not start playing, you must've entered the name incorrectly.
    - Stop:
      - To stop a song, press the "Stop" button.
    - Looping or Repeating:
      - To repeat a song, enter the song name, exactly as shown in the list, into the text box at the bottom of the form.  Then press "Loop Current", if your song did not start playing, you must've entered the name incorrectly.
  
If you close the form, the song will keep playing.  So you can build or do whatever you want to do without the song stopping when you exit.
